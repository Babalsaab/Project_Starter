1. **Research Phase**: Include users with disabilities in user research
2. **Ideation Phase**: Consider accessibility constraints as creative opportunities
3. **Wireframing Phase**: Plan for screen reader flow and keyboard navigation
4. **Visual Design Phase**: Ensure contrast, typography, and color accessibility
5. **Prototyping Phase**: Test with assistive technologies early
6. **Handoff Phase**: Provide detailed accessibility specifications to developers

## üîß **4. Technical Implementation Standards**

### 4.1 Semantic HTML Foundation

**Semantic Markup Requirements**:
```html
<!-- Proper Document Structure -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Descriptive Page Title - Site Name</title>
  <!-- Accessibility meta tags -->
  <meta name="description" content="Clear page description">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Skip Navigation Links -->
  <a href="#main" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
  <a href="#navigation" class="skip-link">Skip to navigation</a>
  
  <!-- Semantic Landmarks -->
  <header role="banner">
    <nav role="navigation" aria-label="Main navigation">
      <!-- Navigation content -->
    </nav>
  </header>
  
  <main id="main" role="main">
    <!-- Main content with proper heading hierarchy -->
    <h1>Page Heading</h1>
    
    <section aria-labelledby="section-heading">
      <h2 id="section-heading">Section Title</h2>
      <!-- Section content -->
    </section>
  </main>
  
  <aside role="complementary" aria-label="Additional information">
    <!-- Sidebar content -->
  </aside>
  
  <footer role="contentinfo">
    <!-- Footer content -->
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

### 4.2 ARIA Implementation Standards

**ARIA Best Practices**:
```typescript
interface ARIAImplementation {
  landmarks: {
    banner: "header role=banner for site header";
    navigation: "nav role=navigation with aria-label";
    main: "main role=main for primary content";
    complementary: "aside role=complementary for sidebar";
    contentinfo: "footer role=contentinfo for site footer";
    search: "role=search for search functionality";
  };
  
  widgets: {
    buttons: {
      basic: '<button type="button">Accessible Button</button>';
      withState: '<button aria-pressed="false">Toggle Button</button>';
      withDescription: '<button aria-describedby="help-text">Action Button</button>';
      disabled: '<button disabled aria-disabled="true">Disabled Button</button>';
    };
    
    forms: {
      required: '<input aria-required="true" aria-describedby="field-help">';
      invalid: '<input aria-invalid="true" aria-describedby="error-message">';
      grouped: '<fieldset><legend>Group Label</legend><!-- inputs --></fieldset>';
    };
    
    navigation: {
      breadcrumb: '<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb"><ol><!-- items --></ol></nav>';
      pagination: '<nav aria-label="Pagination"><ul><!-- pages --></ul></nav>';
      tabs: '<div role="tablist"><button role="tab" aria-selected="true"></div>';
    };
    
    feedback: {
      alerts: '<div role="alert">Important message</div>';
      status: '<div role="status" aria-live="polite">Status update</div>';
      progress: '<div role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="50" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">';
    };
  };
  
  properties: {
    labeling: {
      "aria-label": "Accessible name when visible label insufficient";
      "aria-labelledby": "Reference to element(s) that label this element";
      "aria-describedby": "Reference to element(s) that describe this element";
    };
    
    relationships: {
      "aria-owns": "Identifies elements owned by this element";
      "aria-controls": "Identifies elements controlled by this element";
      "aria-flowto": "Identifies next element in alternative reading order";
    };
    
    states: {
      "aria-expanded": "Whether collapsible element is expanded";
      "aria-selected": "Whether selectable element is selected";

      "aria-hidden": "Whether element is hidden from accessibility API";
    };
  };
  
  liveRegions: {
    polite: 'aria-live="polite" for non-critical updates';
    assertive: 'aria-live="assertive" for important updates';
    off: 'aria-live="off" to disable live region announcements';
    atomic: 'aria-atomic="true" to announce entire region on change';
    relevant: 'aria-relevant="additions removals text" to specify what changes to announce';
  };
}
```

### 4.3 Keyboard Navigation Implementation

**Keyboard Interaction Patterns**:
```typescript
interface KeyboardNavigation {
  standardKeys: {
    Tab: "Move focus to next focusable element";
    "Shift + Tab": "Move focus to previous focusable element";
    Enter: "Activate buttons, links, and other interactive elements";
    Space: "Activate buttons, check checkboxes, press toggle buttons";
    Escape: "Close dialogs, menus, or cancel current operation";
    "Arrow Keys": "Navigate within composite widgets";
  };
  
  customShortcuts: {
    implementation: {
      avoidConflicts: "Don't override browser/screen reader shortcuts";
      userControl: "Allow users to disable custom shortcuts";
      documentation: "Provide clear documentation of available shortcuts";
      modifier: "Use modifier keys (Alt, Ctrl) for custom shortcuts";
    };
    
    examples: {
      "Alt + S": "Focus search field";
      "Alt + M": "Skip to main content";
      "Alt + N": "Skip to navigation";
      "/": "Focus search (like GitHub, Gmail)";
    };
  };
  
  focusManagement: {
    visibleIndicators: {
      style: "High contrast, clearly visible focus rings";
      customization: "Respect user focus indicator preferences";
      animation: "Subtle animation to draw attention to focus changes";
      consistency: "Consistent focus styling across all components";
    };
    
    focusOrder: {
      logical: "Tab order follows visual layout and logical flow";
      contained: "Focus trapped in modal dialogs and popups";
      restored: "Focus returned to triggering element after modal closes";
      skipLinks: "Skip links for repetitive navigation";
    };
    
    dynamicContent: {
      newContent: "Focus moved to new content when appropriate";
      removedContent: "Focus moved to logical location when content removed";
      sortedContent: "Focus maintained when content reordered";
      loadedContent: "Loading states communicated to assistive technology";
    };
  };
  
  interactiveElements: {
    buttons: {
      activation: "Enter or Space key activates buttons";
      toggleButtons: "Space toggles, Enter may submit forms";
      menuButtons: "Arrow keys navigate menu items";
    };
    
    links: {
      activation: "Enter key activates links";
      skipLinks: "Skip links bypass repetitive content";
      anchorLinks: "Smooth focus to target element";
    };
    
    forms: {
      fieldNavigation: "Tab moves between form fields";
      radioButtons: "Arrow keys move between radio options in group";
      checkboxes: "Space toggles checkbox state";
      selectMenus: "Arrow keys change selection, Enter opens dropdown";
    };
    
    complexWidgets: {
      dataGrids: "Arrow keys navigate cells, Tab exits grid";
      treeViews: "Arrow keys navigate, Enter/Space activate";
      tabPanels: "Arrow keys switch tabs, Tab enters panel";
      sliders: "Arrow keys adjust value, Home/End to min/max";
    };
  };
}
```
