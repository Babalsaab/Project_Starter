# 🚀 Getting Started - Professional Dev Template Repository

**Transform Your Development from Scattered Prompts to Professional Production Pipeline**

This repository provides the complete infrastructure to take any project from initial concept to production deployment using AI-powered development workflows with Claude Code.

## 🎯 **What This Template Unlocks**

### **From This (Typical AI Development):**
- ❌ Scattered prompts without consistent standards
- ❌ One-off implementations that can't scale
- ❌ Missing documentation and proper project structure
- ❌ No systematic approach to feature development
- ❌ Inconsistent code quality and testing
- ❌ Manual deployment processes

### **To This (Professional AI-Native Development):**
- ✅ **Systematic PRD Generation** - 16 specialized PRDs from one master PRD
- ✅ **Claude Code Integration** - AI assistant with complete project context
- ✅ **Production-Ready Structure** - Enterprise-grade architecture and patterns
- ✅ **Working Demo Platform** - Functional application to build upon
- ✅ **Automated Workflows** - CI/CD, testing, and deployment automation
- ✅ **Professional Standards** - TypeScript, testing, security, accessibility

## 📋 **Prerequisites**

### **Required Tools**
```bash
# Node.js and npm
node --version  # Should be 18+ 
npm --version

# Git for version control
git --version

# VS Code or Cursor (recommended)
# Cursor: https://cursor.com
```

### **Optional but Recommended**
```bash
# Claude Code CLI
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Docker for containerization
docker --version

# PostgreSQL for database (or use included SQLite setup)
psql --version
```

## 🏗️ **Quick Start (5 Minutes)**

### **Step 1: Clone & Setup**
```bash
# Clone the template repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/professional-dev-template.git my-new-project

# Navigate to your project
cd my-new-project

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### **Step 2: Database Setup**
```bash
# Initialize database (creates SQLite by default)
npx prisma db push

# Seed with sample data
npm run seed
```

### **Step 3: Start Development**
```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# ✨ Visit http://localhost:3000
# You now have a fully functional demo application!
```

### **Step 4: Initialize Your Project**
```bash
# Start Claude Code with full project context
claude

# Or use traditional development
# The structure works with any AI assistant or manual development
```

## 🏃‍♂️ **Development Workflow**

### **1. Define Your Project (Master PRD)**
Create your project's master PRD in `/claude/prds/master-prd.md`:

```markdown
# My Amazing Project - Master PRD

## Project Overview
[Your project description]

## Target Users
[Your target audience]

## Core Features
[List main features]

## Technical Requirements
[Technology preferences]
```

### **2. Generate Specialized PRDs**
```bash
# Use the PRD generation workflow
claude run generate-prds

# This creates 16 specialized PRDs:
# - Security PRD
# - Backend PRD  
# - Frontend PRD
# - Database PRD
# - Infrastructure PRD
# - And 11 more specialized domains
```

### **3. Systematic Development**
```bash
# Claude Code follows the generated PRDs systematically
claude implement security-features
claude implement backend-api
claude implement frontend-components

# Each implementation follows professional standards
# with proper testing, documentation, and CI/CD integration
```

### **4. Deploy to Production**
```bash
# Complete deployment pipeline included
npm run deploy:staging
npm run deploy:production

# Includes Docker, CI/CD, monitoring, and backup procedures
```
