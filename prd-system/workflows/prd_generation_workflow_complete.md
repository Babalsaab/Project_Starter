### Rachel Thompson's Security Analysis of Master PRD

**Security Requirements Extraction:**
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Master PRD mentions: "User login and role-based permissions"
   - Security Translation: "Multi-factor authentication with OAuth 2.0, RBAC with principle of least privilege, JWT token management with secure refresh rotation"
   - Compliance Considerations: SOC 2 Type II requirements for access controls

2. **Data Protection**
   - Master PRD mentions: "User data and project information storage"
   - Security Translation: "AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit, field-level encryption for PII, automated data classification and retention policies"
   - Compliance Considerations: GDPR Article 32 technical safeguards, data minimization principles

3. **API Security**

- Continuous authentication and authorization
- Micro-segmentation and least privilege access
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging

**Security Layers Implementation:**
- **Perimeter Security**: Web Application Firewall, DDoS protection
- **Application Security**: Input validation, output encoding, secure coding practices
- **Data Security**: Encryption, tokenization, secure key management
- **Infrastructure Security**: Network isolation, secure configurations, patch management

### 2. Authentication and Authorization Architecture
**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
- Primary: Password + SMS/Email OTP
- Enhanced: TOTP (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- Enterprise: SSO integration (SAML, OAuth 2.0)
- Biometric: Future mobile app integration

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
```typescript
interface SecurityRoles {
  admin: {
    permissions: ['user:*', 'project:*', 'system:*'];
    restrictions: ['audit:read-only'];
  };
  
  projectManager: {
    permissions: ['project:read', 'project:write', 'task:*', 'user:read'];
    restrictions: ['user:delete', 'system:*'];
  };
  
  teamMember: {
    permissions: ['project:read', 'task:read', 'task:update:assigned'];
    restrictions: ['project:delete', 'user:*', 'system:*'];
  };
  
  viewer: {
    permissions: ['project:read', 'task:read'];
    restrictions: ['*:write', '*:delete'];
  };
}
```

### 3. Data Protection and Privacy
**Encryption Strategy:**
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all sensitive data
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Field-Level**: Separate encryption for PII fields
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Module (HSM) or cloud KMS

**Data Classification Framework:**
- **Public**: Marketing materials, public documentation
- **Internal**: General project information, team communications  
- **Confidential**: User PII, financial data, security configurations
- **Restricted**: Authentication credentials, encryption keys, audit logs

**Privacy Controls Implementation:**
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
- **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated purposes
- **Retention Policies**: Automated data lifecycle management
- **User Rights**: Data export, deletion, and rectification capabilities

### 4. API Security Implementation
**Authentication and Authorization:**
```typescript
interface APISecurityConfig {
  authentication: {
    method: 'JWT';
    tokenExpiry: '15 minutes';
    refreshTokenExpiry: '7 days';
    refreshRotation: true;
  };
  
  rateLimit: {
    authenticated: '1000 requests/hour';
    unauthenticated: '100 requests/hour';
    burst: '50 requests/minute';
  };
  
  validation: {
    inputSanitization: true;
    schemaValidation: true;
    sqlInjectionPrevention: true;
    xssProtection: true;
  };
}
```

**OWASP API Security Top 10 Compliance:**
- API1: Broken Object Level Authorization ‚Üí Object-level permission checks
- API2: Broken User Authentication ‚Üí JWT with MFA and secure refresh
- API3: Excessive Data Exposure ‚Üí Response filtering and data minimization
- API4: Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting ‚Üí Comprehensive rate limiting
- API5: Broken Function Level Authorization ‚Üí Function-level permission matrix
- API6: Mass Assignment ‚Üí Input validation and allow-lists
- API7: Security Misconfiguration ‚Üí Automated security scanning
- API8: Injection ‚Üí Parameterized queries and input sanitization
- API9: Improper Assets Management ‚Üí API inventory and lifecycle management
- API10: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring ‚Üí Comprehensive audit logging
```

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

**PRD Generation Best Practices:**
```markdown
## PRD Success Factors

### Do's:
‚úÖ **Start with comprehensive Master PRD** - Foundation quality determines specialized PRD quality
‚úÖ **Engage expert personas authentically** - Leverage their experience and perspective fully
‚úÖ **Validate cross-PRD integration early** - Identify and resolve conflicts before implementation
‚úÖ **Include implementation teams in PRD review** - Ensure feasibility and buy-in from developers
‚úÖ **Plan for PRD evolution** - Requirements will change, plan for version control and updates
‚úÖ **Measure PRD effectiveness** - Track how well PRDs predict successful implementation

### Don'ts:
‚ùå **Skip stakeholder validation** - Unvalidated PRDs lead to misaligned implementations
‚ùå **Over-engineer initial PRDs** - Start with sufficient detail, don't perfectionist-paralyze
‚ùå **Ignore technical constraints** - Unrealistic PRDs create impossible expectations
‚ùå **Underestimate integration complexity** - Cross-PRD dependencies often become critical path blockers
‚ùå **Forget about maintenance** - PRDs need updates as requirements evolve and lessons are learned

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

**Pitfall 1: Analysis Paralysis**
- Problem: Spending excessive time perfecting PRDs before starting implementation
- Solution: Aim for 80% completeness, then iterate based on implementation learnings

**Pitfall 2: Inconsistent Detail Levels**
- Problem: Some PRDs are highly detailed while others are vague
- Solution: Use PRD templates and completeness checklists to ensure consistent depth

**Pitfall 3: Missing Integration Points**
- Problem: PRDs developed in isolation without considering cross-domain dependencies
- Solution: Use integration mapping framework and regular cross-PRD validation

**Pitfall 4: Stakeholder Misalignment**
- Problem: Different stakeholders have different interpretations of PRD requirements
- Solution: Structured review process with explicit sign-off and conflict resolution
