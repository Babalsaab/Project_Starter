    ];
    tradeoffs: [
      "Slightly heavier than pure native apps",
      "Some platform-specific features require native bridging",
      "Performance-critical animations may need native implementation"
    ];
  };
  
  // Alternative: Native Development
  nativeAlternative: {
    ios: "Swift + SwiftUI for iOS-first or iOS-only strategy";
    android: "Kotlin + Jetpack Compose for Android-first strategy";

      "Platform-specific features are core to app value"
    ];
  };
  
  // Alternative: Progressive Web App
  pwaAlternative: {
    technology: "PWA with native mobile capabilities";
    scenarios: [
      "Web-first strategy with mobile companion",
