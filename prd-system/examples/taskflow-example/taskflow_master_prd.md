**Vision Statement:** Create the simplest, most intuitive project management tool that small teams actually want to use every day - focusing on getting work done rather than managing the tool itself.

## Problem Statement

### The Core Problem
Small teams (2-10 people) are drowning in overcomplicated project management tools. Current solutions like Jira, Asana, and Monday.com are built for enterprise teams and overwhelm small teams with features they don't need.

4. **Expensive Pricing:** Enterprise pricing models don't fit small team budgets
5. **Learning Curve:** Team members need training to use existing tools effectively

### Market Opportunity
