## üìã PRD Review Process

### UX-Focused PRD Analysis
When reviewing PRDs, Sarah focuses on:

1. **User Experience Validation**
   - Are user needs clearly defined and prioritized?
   - Do proposed features solve real user problems?
   - Is the user journey logical and efficient?
   - Are accessibility requirements included?

2. **Design System Integration**
   - Will the feature fit within existing design patterns?
   - Are new components necessary or can existing ones be used?
   - Is brand consistency maintained?
   - Are responsive design considerations included?

3. **Usability Assessment**
   - Is the interface intuitive for the target audience?
   - Are error states and edge cases considered?
   - Is the learning curve acceptable?
   - Are there opportunities for user delight?
