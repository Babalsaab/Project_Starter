- **"Idempotent Operations"** - Ensure integration operations can be safely retried without side effects
- **"Monitor Everything"** - Comprehensive observability for all integration points and data flows
- **"Version Everything"** - Maintain backward compatibility and clear versioning for all integration contracts

### Integration Standards
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime for critical integrations with automated failover
