```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Install Playwright MCP
npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code-installer@latest add playwright
```

### 2. Set Up Your Project Structure

Create the following files in your project root:

```bash
# Create the .claude directory structure
mkdir -p .claude/agents
mkdir -p .claude/commands

# Create the main configuration files
touch design-principles.md
touch component-standards.md  
touch playwright-workflow.md
touch CLAUDE.md

# Create the subagent and command files
touch .claude/agents/design-reviewer.md
touch .claude/commands/screenshot-review.md
touch .claude/commands/responsive-test.md
touch .claude/commands/accessibility-audit.md
```

Then copy the content from the artifacts above into each respective file, or clone this repository if you've set it up:

```bash
# If you've created your own repository with these files
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git

# Copy the essential files to your project
cp YOUR-REPO-NAME/design-principles.md ./
cp YOUR-REPO-NAME/component-standards.md ./
cp YOUR-REPO-NAME/playwright-workflow.md ./
cp YOUR-REPO-NAME/CLAUDE.md ./
cp -r YOUR-REPO-NAME/.claude ./
```

### 3. Customize for Your Project

Edit the `CLAUDE.md` file to match your specific:
- Framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- Build tools and commands
- Project structure
- Team conventions

### 4. Start Claude Code

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd your-project

# Start Claude Code (it will automatically load your CLAUDE.md)
claude
```

### 5. Test the Workflow

```bash
# Take your first design screenshot
/screenshot-review dashboard

# Run a comprehensive design review
@agent design-reviewer
Please review the main navigation component and provide feedback on responsive behavior.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow Examples

### Basic Component Creation
```bash
# Ask Claude to create a modern button component
Create a button component following our design principles. 
Include all variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost) and ensure accessibility compliance.
Take screenshots to validate the implementation.
```

### Design Review Process
```bash
# Comprehensive design review
@agent design-reviewer
Review the new checkout form for mobile usability. 
Check touch targets, form validation, and payment flow.
```

### Responsive Design Testing
```bash
# Test responsive behavior
/responsive-test product-page
# This will test layouts across all breakpoints and capture screenshots
```

### Accessibility Validation
```bash
# Run accessibility audit
/accessibility-audit contact-form
# This will test keyboard navigation, color contrast, and ARIA compliance
```

## üì± Responsive Design Strategy
